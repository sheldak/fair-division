# TODO Create files with information about agents and their valuations that can be read.
# Also, add allocations to that files that are (or are not) EF, EF1, EFX etc to verify checkers.
# Same files can be used to just load valuations and then run algorithms to verify if algorithms
# return proper allocations.
